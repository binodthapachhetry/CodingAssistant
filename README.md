# Cross repository coding AI assistant

## 1.	Cross-Codebase Context
    •	Most AI coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Aider, ChatGPT plugins, etc.) are typically bound to a single project at a time.
    •	Your proposed system goes one step further: it indexes two (or more) distinct codebases and understands how their components might integrate.
    •	This supports a use case that typical code assistants don’t address well: porting, reusing, or adapting code from one repository into another.

## 2.	Documentation + Code Linking
    •	Combining code and documentation from two separate projects ensures you have the necessary domain insights for each codebase.
    •	This is crucial because blindly copying a function without context (library dependencies, environment configs, licensing constraints) can lead to misintegration or errors.
    •	If your system also surfaces relevant doc snippets (e.g., “This function requires dependency X and config Y”), it provides more confidence in the reusability or adaptation steps.

## 3.	Practical Developer Workflow
    •	In real-world dev workflows, engineers often have to learn from existing code (in-house or open-source) and adapt those patterns.
    •	A typical scenario: “We built feature X in a previous microservice. Let’s port the same logic into our new microservice.”
    •	Another scenario: “We found an open-source library that does advanced image processing; can we integrate these pieces into our codebase with minimal friction?”
    •	A cross-repo assistant that understands both codebases, relevant docs, and usage context would significantly speed up this process.
